# -commerce Platform's Order Management System

A growing e-commerce company needs a scalable and efficient order management
system to handle the increasing volume of online transactions. The system should
manage the entire order lifecycle, from placement to fulfilment and delivery. It should
integrate with various subsystems, such as product catalogues, inventory
management, payment gateways, and shipping providers. The system should also
support real-time order tracking, customer notifications, and analytics to optimise the
supply chain and improve customer satisfaction
