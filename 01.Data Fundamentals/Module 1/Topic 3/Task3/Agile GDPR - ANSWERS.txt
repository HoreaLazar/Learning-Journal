1. Will any GDPR restrictions apply?
Yes, GDPR applies since we're handling personal data like age, postcode, and skin tone. This data needs to be processed carefully under GDPR rules.

2. What rights can the data subjects exercise?
Data subjects have several rights:
- Right to be informed: Know how their data is used.
- Right of access: See their data.
- Right to rectification: Fix inaccurate data.
- Right to erasure: Request data deletion.
- Right to restrict processing: Limit data usage.
- Right to object: Say no to their data being used.
- Right to data portability: Get their data in a usable format.
- Rights on automated decisions: Challenge or ask for human review.

3. Is a DPIA required?
Yes, a DPIA is needed because sensitive data (like skin tone) is involved, and there's a risk of profiling and affecting people’s privacy.

4. What other recommendations do you have?
- Data minimization: Only collect what’s necessary.
- Anonymize data: If possible, anonymize it.
- Consent: Make sure consent is properly gathered.
- Retention policy: Set clear rules on how long data is kept.

5. Do you include the story in this sprint?
No, it shouldn’t go in this sprint. We need to handle GDPR stuff first, like completing the DPIA.

6. Do you suggest any additional acceptance criteria?
Yes, add:
- GDPR compliance, including consent and a DPIA.
- Data anonymization where possible.
- A way for users to exercise their rights.

7. Review the User Story points.
The story might need more points. GDPR stuff adds complexity, so it could be worth bumping it up.
