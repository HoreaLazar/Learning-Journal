# Financial Institution's Customer Data Platform

A large financial institution aims to develop a comprehensive customer data platform
to enhance its services and personalise customer experiences. The platform should
integrate data from multiple sources, including core banking systems, credit card
transactions, investment portfolios, and customer interactions across various
channels (e.g., online banking, mobile apps, and branch visits). The system should
enable the bank to gain a 360-degree view of each customer, support targeted
marketing campaigns, and facilitate risk assessment and fraud detection.
