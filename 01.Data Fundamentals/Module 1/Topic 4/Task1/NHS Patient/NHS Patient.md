# NHS Patient Data Management System

```
The National Health Service (NHS) requires a centralised system to manage patient
data across multiple healthcare facilities, including hospitals, clinics, and general
practitioners. The system should facilitate the secure storage, retrieval, and sharing
of patient information, such as medical history, test results, and treatment plans. It
should also enable the integration of data from various sources, including electronic
health records (EHRs), medical devices, and wearables
