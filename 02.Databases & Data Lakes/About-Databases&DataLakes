# Module 2 - Databases & Data Lakes

## Topic 1 - Storing and querying data

### Which technologies do you use for data storage at work?
+ Relational Databases (SQL-based) - Microsoft SQL Server
+ Cloud Storage Solutions - Microsoft Azure Blob Storage
+ Data Lakehouse - name/provider, more info!!!
+ SharePoint
+ File Storage Systems - NFS (Network File System)

### Why are businesses not throwing away data?
To understand customers better, predict trends, improve products, make smart decisions, and stay competitive. 
Sometimes to sell or share data for extra money.

### On-premise pros and cons
+ On-Premise Pros:
Full control over infrastructure
Enhanced security for sensitive data
Easier compliance with strict regulations
Potentially better performance for high-demand apps
Customizable to specific business needs

+ On-Premise Cons:
High upfront costs
Requires ongoing maintenance and updates
Difficult and costly to scale
Complicated disaster recovery
Limited remote access compared to cloud solutions

### The data model description generally consists of three parts:​
+ Structure of the data – what does it look like
+ Operations on the data – what's available
+ Constraints on the data – what's allowed

### Terminology
• Relations/Tables
• Columns/Attributes/Fields
• Rows/Tuples/Records
• Degree (arity) of a relation = #attributes
• Cardinality of  a relation = #tuples

Student(id:INT, sname:VARCHAR(50), age:INT, gpa:FLOAT)

### Define a relational schema in SQL
Create, Show, Order

### RDBS data - Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)

### Questions: 
Do we use Architecture diagrams in our company? Who is responsible?
- 
Data storage - Data Lakehouse (details: provider=Azure?, type, structure)
- As Data Lakehouse we use Microsoft Fabric and Microsoft Azure

## Topic 2 - Schemas and integrations

OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) and 
OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) systems

+ Why might an organisation prefer the simplicity of a star schema for reporting and
querying purposes?
For its simplicity, ease of use, and performance benefits. The straightforward structure makes it easy to understand, write queries, and use with BI tools. The denormalized design reduces complex joins, leading to faster query performance, which is ideal for reporting and analytics.

+ Explain the differences between the normal forms and denormalized data, their pros and cons, and which is the best.
1NF: Data should be atomic (no lists/repeating groups). Pro: Simple structure. Con: Can still be redundant.
2NF: No partial dependencies (must depend on the whole key). Pro: Less redundancy. Con: More tables.
3NF: No transitive dependencies (attributes depend only on the primary key). Pro: Minimal redundancy, better integrity. Con: Complex queries.
Denormalized Data: Tables are merged, allowing some redundancy. Pro: Faster queries. Con: More storage, and potential data issues.
Best Choice: 3NF for clean, consistent data; denormalized for faster performance. I prefer 3NF for data integrity but denormalized for quick access.

+ How does Apache Iceberg enhance data management strategies, particularly in environments requiring frequent updates to the data schema?
Schema Evolution: Allows easy schema changes without table rewrites.
Atomic Transactions: Ensures data consistency and prevents partial updates.
Flexible Partitioning: Supports changes without costly reorganization.
Efficient Metadata: Manages metadata for quick access to evolving data.
Compatibility: Works with multiple engines for easy integration.
These features make Iceberg ideal for managing frequently changing data environments.

### Update the learning journal with the following:
List of databases that you have encountered at work - Azure
Whether these databases are open-source or not - Not. Paid 
If they are cloud or on-premise - Cloud
Is internal training available in-house on how to use them efficiently? - Yes

## Topic 4 - Schemas and integrations 

Analyse 'Data Profiling - Sheet1.csv' file:
Issues: 
- duplicate records: John Smith (rows 2 and 10) and Jane Doe (rows 3 and 7)
- missing data (NULL and N/A)
- inconsistent Values (NULL vs N/A)
- lack of data validation (Email, DateOfBirth, Phone - they should be mandatory)
- ambiguity in CustomerID data (row 11 - customer 10 has NULL everywhere)
To do: 
- remove duplicates, 
- use only NULL for missing data, 
- validate data for email, phone and addresses
- fill in the missing data where possible 

1. Benefits of Data Archiving: saves storage costs, Boosts system performance, Ensures compliance, secures long-term data, enables historical analysis, aids disaster recovery.
2. Why Data Archiving is Needed: manages data growth, meets compliance mandates, optimizes storage, improves system efficiency and preserves data for future use
