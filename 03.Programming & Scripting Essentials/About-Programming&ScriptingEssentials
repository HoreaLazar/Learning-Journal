### Module 3 Task 2 - Data structures and OOP

The primary data structures in Python are:
Fundamental types - Integers, Floats, Strings, Booleans
Non-fundamental types - Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, Sets

The benefits of data serialisation include:
• Data persistence: Serialisation allows you to save the state of an object to a file or database, enabling long-term storage
• Data exchange: Serialisation enables data to be easily shared between different systems, platforms, or applications
• Performance: Serialised data can be efficiently transmitted over networks, reducing bandwidth usage and improving communication speed

The Singleton pattern is particularly useful for managing resources such as database connections, configuration settings, or logging instances in data engineering projects.
