Thank you for your submission. So you're aware of how feedback will look, it will be broken into three sections:

Strengths - What you did well
Areas of Improvement - Where you can look for tweaks for this report
Future Development - Key areas to look at before your next assessment
Strengths

Really interesting idea that you have conveyed.
Clear objective and direction to the report.
Great use of evidence to highlight key details in the project.
Areas of Improvement

It would be good to know the stakeholders involved in the project - how did this project come about? What were the objectives/tasks ("validate data" is quite generic - what did they actually want)?
What are the next steps when it comes to CI/CD? e.g. how will you future proof this project against data changes?
"In this project, it was found that the UK server files have fewer rows than the client (Senpiper) files, indicating potential data loss or incomplete data transfer." - this seems quite big! I would definitely look into this more.
Future Development

Try to avoid lots of bullet points to help the flow of the report.
Reporting metrics, like ROI, FTE saved % quality improvement, can help leaders understand project impact
