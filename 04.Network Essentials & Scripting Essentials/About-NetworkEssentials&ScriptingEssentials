CIA Triad - Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability
The CIA triad is a fundamental concept in cybersecurity that outlines three essential principles for protecting information: Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability.
Symmetric and asymmetric encryption:
- Symmetric encryption algorithms such as Data Encryption Standard (DES), 3DES, and
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) are based on the premise that each communicating party
knows the pre-shared key.
Symmetric algorithms use the same pre-shared key (secret key) to encrypt and decrypt data.
Symmetric encryption algorithms are commonly used with VPN traffic because they use less
CPU resources than asymmetric encryption algorithms.
Most encryption keys are between 112 and 256 bits. Use a longer key for more secure
communications

- Data confidentiality can also be ensured using asymmetric algorithms, including Rivest, Shamir,
and Adleman (RSA) and the public key infrastructure (PKI).
Asymmetric algorithms, also called public-key algorithms, are designed so that the
encryption and the decryption keys are different.
Asymmetric algorithms use a public key and a private key. Both keys can be encrypted, but the complementary paired key is required for decryption. 
Asymmetric encryption can use key lengths between 512 to 4,096 bits.

Public Key (Encrypt) + Private Key (Decrypt) = Confidentiality
Private Key (Encrypt) + Public Key (Decrypt) = Authentication

PKI - Public Key Infrastructure
CA - The Certificate Authority
RA - Registration Authority
HMAC - Keyed-Hash Message Authentication
MAC - Message Authentication Code
NIST Cybersecurity - Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover
ARO - Annual Rate of Occurrence
SLE - Single Loss Expectancy
ALE - Annual Loss Expectancy
