##M odule 7 - Topic 1 - Event-driven architectures (EDA) fundamentals

# Event-Driven Architectures (EDA):

EDA allows for asynchronous communication between system components, enhancing responsiveness and scalability.

Key components include events, event producers, event consumers, and event brokers.


# The Pub-Sub Model:

In the Pub-Sub model, publishers emit messages to specific topics, and subscribers receive messages based on their interests.

This model decouples producers and consumers, improving system flexibility and scalability.


# Apache Kafka:

Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform used for high-throughput, fault-tolerant data streams.

Core concepts include topics, partitions, producers, consumers, consumer groups, and Kafka clusters.

Kafka ensures data consistency through replication and treats each partition as an immutable log.


# Collaboration and Presentation Skills

Effective collaboration involves clear communication, defined roles, and regular meetings.

Crafting captivating presentations requires a clear objective, logical flow, and engaging storytelling techniques.

Tailor your message to the audience, use real-world examples, and incorporate visual aids to enhance understanding.


# Examples of Real-World Applications

Banking: Real-time fraud detection using Kafka to process transactions instantly.

Human resources: Seamless propagation of employee data changes across systems.

Charities: Monitoring donation activities to boost donor engagement.
