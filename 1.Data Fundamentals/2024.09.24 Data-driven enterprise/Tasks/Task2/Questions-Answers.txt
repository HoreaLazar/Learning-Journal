QUESTIONS: 
• You may want to drop (skip) the SRA Code as it's only provided for one
dataset and not useful for the other two (i.e. the majority of) datasets. Make
sure you document your choice 
- We only have an SRA code for the Mwanza region/sheet. The other two don't have one. 

• What health facility types are there? (Hint: you can find out from the header in
the Mwanza sheet)
- HOSP = Hospital, HC = Health Centre and DISP = Dispensary

• What ownership types are there? You may want to include ownership type as
it's useful for the majority of the datasets (two datasets specify it, one doesn't).
Make sure you document any assumptions you make as to the meaning.
- We have Ownership data only on the DSM (ilala) region/sheet.
- Types: Private, FBO, Public, LGA, Prison, Private-FBO, Police, Military, Parastatal, Private-NGO

• Are star levels/rating levels the same for all the datasets? Is it safe to
assume that they may follow the same distribution or not?
- No. Mwanza's star rating range is from 0 to 2 and on Pwani and DSM (ilala) is from 0 to 3. They have different distributions. We can't combine them. 

• Pwani and DSM(Ilala) contain multiple tables inside them, so you need to
merge the data. You may want to skip the row numbering as it's not
particularly useful at this stage. Note how in DSM(Ilala) the tables are "side-
by-side" and need to be "split in half" and there is one missing column name
across all of them.
- the Star Rating is the missing column name based on the data (and the table duplication).

• Pwani does not explicitly declare facility types but they can be inferred from
the facility name
- Because only some names have the facility type included, is irrelevant to make a column with it.

• Pay attention to spelling mistakes, duplicates and missing data and have a
plan of how to deal with those. Make sure the capitalisation remains
consistent
- Mwanza: Duplicated names with same Start Rating (Nyakato)
- Mwanza: Duplicated names with different Star Rating (Busisi, Upendo) but different HF Type (DISP, HC)
- Mwanza: Some names with capital letters, some with small letters. We should change all to be with capital letters as they are on the other regions/sheets.
- Mwanza: We have a name as '?? Bot'

- Pwani: Duplicated Health Facilities, some with the same Star Rating and some (HF Name: Ghata) with different ones
- Pwani: Mchinga has 5 entries with 0 Star Rating
- Pwani: We have a name as 'Access'

- DSM: Missing column name. Based on the data and columns duplication, it should be Star Level
- DSM: On HC right table we have missing data, but is irrelevant as it is a duplication and it doesn't have to be the same as the table from the left. We can use the data. 
- DSM: We have SN but we will not use them as the other regions don't have one.
- DSM: Public-Parastatal has Wrap-Text active

• Create a schema with at least the following fields: Region, HF Name, HF
Type, Ownership Type. Decide what to do with star rating. In the schema,
explain the data types, ranges, whether missing values are allowed, and
provide a description of the meanings
- DONE

• The schema should be in the same excel file as your clean data, albeit as a
separate sheet
- DONE
