+ **Recognise** fundamental data types and data source types, key Data
Engineering technological standards and best practices, and relevant
regulations
+ **Apply** fundamental principles for fostering a data-driven culture through
collaborating with diverse stakeholders in Agile and Lean teams, avoiding
waste and respecting organisational processes for data quality and data
project management
+ **Model* standardised Big Data ecosystems and architectures for enterprise
data using visual approaches and comprehend how to design rudimentary
data products, and how they add value to the organisation
+ **Explain** the importance of assessing, improving, and maintaining data quality
using frameworks and methodologies to ensure data accuracy, completeness,
and consistency.

# Data quality:
+ Data quality refers to measuring how well your data meets both the technical and business requirements to support its intended use

# Data quality dimensions/metrics: 
+ Accuracy
+ Integrity
+ Consistency
+ Timeliness

# Open standards 
+ are guidelines for technology that anyone can use and contribute to

# FAIR data are data which meet the principles of 
+ findability
+ accessibility
+ interoperability
+ reusability

# UK Standards:
https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/learning-hub/research-data-management/collaborative-research/standards/

# The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) 
+ offers a set of metadata standards used to describe resources in various domains.

# Challenges of unstandardised data
+ Data silos
+ Inconsistencies
+ Integration issues

# Data formats:
+ **XML (Extensible Markup Language)** is a markup language designed for structuring and exchanging data between systems, promoting interoperability
+ **CSV (Comma-Separated Values)** is a widely used format for storing and exchanging tabular data, commonly used in spreadsheets and for data integration and analysis tasks
+ **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)** is a lightweight, human-readable format primarily used for transmitting data between servers and web applications, enhancing user experiences and performance

# Data quality issues:
+ Missing values
+ Incorrect data types
+ Duplicate entries

# Focus on sustainability:
+ Compression
+ Green Data Transfer

# Data Quality Framework (DMAIC):
+ Define
+ Measure
+ Analyse
+ Improve 
+ Control
